        they work together to understand and solve them, their marriage stays
        happy. If not, these problems can turn a good marriage into a difficult
        one.

              Marriage is when two people come together with love and
              understanding. It's a special bond between a husband and wife. In
              India, there are many different cultures and religions, so people
              may have different beliefs. Sometimes, your partner may hurt you,
              and your marriage may feel like it's not working. But astrology
              can help solve marriage problems by resolving conflicts and
              misunderstandings. It's important to address these issues early to
              avoid bigger problems later on.
            </p>

              Sometimes, when you're in a relationship, you might face
              difficulties that make you think about marriage. You don't want to
              be hurt anymore by your partner. These changes might be because of
              planetary movements or astrological signs in your birth chart. But
              don't worry, astrology can provide positive solutions for marriage
              problems. It can help with any issues you face in your
              relationship, whether before or after getting married. It's
              important to approach this with a calm mind, as a calm person is
              more likely to turn to astrology for help, rather than getting
              angry.

              When our partner plays with our emotions, it can be very painful.
              Some partners realize their mistake and try to make amends, while
              others don't. Dealing with the ones who don't can be confusing and
              frustrating. You might seek advice on how to handle the situation,
              but figuring out the right solution can be confusing. This is
              where marriage problem solutions come in handy. Om Astro Service,
