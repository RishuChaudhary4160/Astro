                    We often hear that marriage is meant to be perfect, but in
                    reality, every marriage is unique. Every couple faces some
                    small issues, but when they work together to understand and
                    solve them, their marriage stays happy. If not, these
                    problems can turn a good marriage into a difficult one.

                    Marriage is when two people come together with love and
                    understanding. It's a special bond between a husband and
                    wife. In India, there are many different cultures and
                    religions, so people may have different beliefs. Sometimes,
                    your partner may hurt you, and your marriage may feel like
                    it's not working. But astrology can help solve marriage
                    problems by resolving conflicts and misunderstandings. It's
                    important to address these issues early to avoid bigger
                    problems later on.

                    Sometimes, when you're in a relationship, you might face
                    difficulties that make you think about marriage. You don't
                    want to be hurt anymore by your partner. These changes might
                    be because of planetary movements or astrological signs in
                    your birth chart. But don't worry, astrology can provide
                    positive solutions for marriage problems. It can help with
                    any issues you face in your relationship, whether before or
                    after getting married. It's important to approach this with
                    a calm mind, as a calm person is more likely to turn to
                    astrology for help, rather than getting angry.

                    When our partner plays with our emotions, it can be very
                    painful. Some partners realize their mistake and try to make
                    amends, while others don't. Dealing with the ones who don't
                    can be confusing and frustrating. You might seek advice on
                    how to handle the situation, but figuring out the right
                    solution can be confusing. This is where marriage problem
